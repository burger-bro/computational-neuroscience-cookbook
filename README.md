## 1 Basics  
### 1.1 Reading List  
1. **[The Cognitive Neurosciences(Micheal S. Gazzaniga)](books/Gazzaniga.%20The%20Cognitive%20Neurosciences.pdf)**<br>
   For students who are not majoring in psychology backgroung, this book is recommended to suplement some basic knowledge of cognitive neuroscience. This book can be read as a novel giving you a comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of brain cognition.
2. **[Theoretical Neuroscience Computational(Peter Dayan)](books/Theoretical%20Neuroscience%20Computational%20and%20Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Neural%20Systems%20-%20%20Peter%20Dayan,%20L.%20F.%20Abbott.pdf)**<br>
    This is a classic textbook on computational neuroscience. But I don't think this book is a must-read, as much of the content is actually very difficult.
